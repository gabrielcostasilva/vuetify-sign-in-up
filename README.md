# Vuetify Sign in/ Sign up
This project is based on an ["AAE IdeaPro" Vuetify tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XPOyEUpMGPQ).

## Project Overview

This is a sign in/sign up page made out of Vuetify components. This is just a shell, without any real functionality. In addition, all code is in one single page - no components. Checkout other branchs to see the evolution of this project.

### Main Screen
